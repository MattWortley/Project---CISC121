Decomposition: Create a Program that includes a header, explanation, and an input for the user to enter a list of numbers and a target value they want to find. Next, grab the numbers and create an array to check. Go one by one over the list and check whether the target equals the value at each index. Document each step for the user to see what is happening behind the scenes. Finally, create an output that shares each step taken to find the target value and outputs the result. If found, tell the user that it is in the array and the index it was found; if not, tell the user that it is not inside the numbers given. 

Abstraction: Grab user input of numbers and target, perform linear search to see if target value is in the numbers given, output the results and index if found, or if not found, tell the user.

Pattern Recognition: There is not much of a pattern; the only “pattern” is the loop that goes over the numbers in the list to find whether the target value was found. It isn’t a pattern rather just a loop that happens once throughout the entirety of the runtime, as the user can use the program more than once.

Algorithm Design: Input given: A list of numbers given by the user, and the target for the search. Process: Linear Search, go through the list of numbers and check whether the target is equal to the value at the index of the array. Output: The index that the number was found in or that it was not found at all, and the steps per iteration through the indexes.

Plan: Inside a sketch book, I laid out details of how I want to go about this project. I listed the steps on how to start it. First, I would want to get a user input of numbers and the targeted number that they would like. I would most likely have to take the string input of numbers and ask the user to separate them by a space to split them. Next, I would like to verify and search to find if the target is inside the given array. Next, I will have to create some sort of String array or queue to hold each step inside of a loop going through each of the numbers. Then, after the loop has finished, I will have to output to the user whether the number was in the array given or not, and output all steps taken to find it. Finally, I will have to make a clean UI and add details for the project specifications.

Steps to Run:
1. Give numbers to the designated space with space separation
2. Give a target value in the designated space
3. Hit the "Run Linear Search" button
4. See results below, as well as each step of the search
